##  Questions


# Add at least 3 Project features 

-   ## React Router DOM :
    React router is one of the most powerful and most used feature. This feature show the actual power of React's Virtual DOM. React Router can route or navigate one page to another page or one UI to another UI without any loading! This is may be most powerful thing in React! I am very satisfied for having this feature! My full project is based on this feature! My home page, donation page, my statistics page is route on this feature! I can navigate one page to another page with using the NavLink component, and if i want ot pass the value from one page to another page i can use the most useful thing is loader and useLoaderData hook. This hook can store the shared data from page i came present page!


-   ## State Management :
    State management is one of the most important and major part of an react project! State without state management we can not fully completed any project. State management is used for store the data, use as conditonal value, use for conditional rendering and so many things.
    I used useState() hook for state management. I store my json data in a state and then i map it and use it. 
    Also i use state for conditional rendering in my responsive navbar , showing toast and show the See All button. I manage my all the state by using "useState()" hook. useState() hook is a builtin function that give us the chance to update spacefic update and on this update we can render someting on your html page. In this project I used many useState() hook and manage my states properly.


-   ## Conditional Rendering :
    In React, conditional rendering is the process of displaying different content based data. I can use useState() hook as my conditional value and i know that conditional rendering is one of the most important feature in react because sometimes we do some work with dynamic value, based this value we create user, display users information, data and so many things, If you are not able to manage your state dynamically you can to work with conditinal rendering process! conditional Rendering thats why most used and commonly used features is react. Conditional Rendering is my personal favorite thnig in React.Js. Because we can render any thing based on any condion! If there are 3 major features in React.js then Conditonal Rendering is one of it! React allows conditionally render components or elements based on the application's state. This enables dynamic UIs that adapt to changing data and user interactions. I use conditional Rendering for showing alert. I stored setTimeout Function and then update the state and then based on the state
